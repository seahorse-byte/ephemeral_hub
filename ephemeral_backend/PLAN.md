# Plan

## üèóÔ∏è Production-Grade Backend (Axum)

The backend is the most critical part to get right. A production server must be robust, scalable, and secure.

### 1\. State & File Management (Scalability)

Your application servers should be **stateless**. This means you can run multiple instances behind a load balancer without any issues. The state is managed externally.

  * **File Storage:** Storing files on the server's local filesystem (`/tmp`) won't work in a multi-server setup and isn't durable.

      * **Solution:** Use a dedicated **Object Storage** service.
          * **Cloud:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or DigitalOcean Spaces.
          * **Self-Hosted:** MinIO (an S3-compatible server you can run yourself).
      * **Implementation:** When a user uploads a file, your Axum server streams it directly to the object store. For downloads, you generate a **pre-signed URL** with a short expiration time (e.g., 5 minutes) and redirect the user to it. This offloads the bandwidth from your server and is more secure.

  * **Metadata (Redis):** Your use of Redis is already a great start.

      * **Solution:** In production, use a **managed Redis instance** (like AWS ElastiCache, Google Memorystore, or Redis Cloud). This gives you automated backups, scaling, and high availability without the operational overhead.
      * **Connection Pooling:** Use the `deadpool_redis` crate to manage Redis connections efficiently under load.

### 2\. Configuration & Secrets

Never hardcode configuration values.

  * **Configuration:** Use a crate like `figment` or `config-rs` to load settings from a file (e.g., `config.toml`) and overwrite them with **environment variables**. This allows you to use different settings for development, staging, and production.
  * **Secrets:** Database URLs, API keys, and other secrets must **NEVER** be in your git repository. Load them exclusively from environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service (like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault).

### 3\. Error Handling & Validation

Production code cannot `panic!`.

  * **Robust Errors:** Define a custom application error type using the `thiserror` crate. Your API handlers should return `Result<T, AppError>`. Create a global Axum middleware that converts your `AppError` into a clean, user-friendly JSON error response with the correct HTTP status code.
  * **Input Validation:** All data from the outside world is untrusted. Use the `validator` crate to automatically validate incoming API request bodies (e.g., ensuring text isn't too long, IDs have the correct format).

<!-- end list -->

```rust
// Example of a validated request body
use serde::Deserialize;
use validator::Validate;

#[derive(Deserialize, Validate)]
pub struct UpdateTextBinRequest {
    #[validate(length(max = 100_000))]
    pub content: String,
}
```

## üåê Production-Grade Web UI (Dioxus)

The frontend needs to be fast, reliable, and provide a smooth user experience.

### 1\. Performance & Asset Delivery

  * **Build Optimization:** Always compile your Dioxus app in release mode (`dioxus build --release`) and run `wasm-opt -O3` on the output WASM file to shrink its size and improve performance.
  * **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Serve your static assets (the compiled WASM, JavaScript glue code, and CSS) through a **CDN** like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront. This dramatically speeds up initial load times for users around the world and reduces the load on your server.

### 2\. User Experience (UX)

  * **Loading States:** Never show a blank page. Use skeleton loaders or simple spinners while fetching initial data for a hub.
  * **Optimistic Updates:** For the whiteboard, when a user draws a line, render it on their screen *immediately*. Simultaneously, send the data to the server. If the server confirms, do nothing. If it fails, remove the line and show an error. This makes the UI feel instantaneous.
  * **Connection Handling:** If the WebSocket connection drops, don't just fail. Implement a reconnection strategy with exponential backoff and display a "Reconnecting..." message in the UI.

## üîí Security Deep Dive

This is non-negotiable for a production application.

  * **HTTPS Everywhere:** Your service must only be available over HTTPS. This is typically handled at the load balancer or reverse proxy level (e.g., Nginx, Caddy, or a managed cloud load balancer).
  * **Rate Limiting:** Protect your API from abuse and denial-of-service attacks. Use a middleware crate like `tower_governor` to limit the number of requests a single IP can make in a given time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
  * **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Configure CORS on your Axum backend very strictly. Only allow requests from your specific domain. Do not use a wildcard (`*`) in production.
  * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Set a strong CSP header to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by defining which sources of content (scripts, styles, images) are allowed.

-----

## üìä Observability (Logging, Metrics, Tracing)

If you can't see what your application is doing, you can't support it.

  * **Structured Logging:** Use the `tracing` crate with `tracing-subscriber` to emit structured logs (e.g., in JSON format). This allows you to easily search, filter, and analyze logs in a service like Datadog, Grafana Loki, or the AWS CloudWatch.

      * Log every incoming request and its outcome (status code, latency).
      * Log key events, like `space_created`, `file_uploaded`, `space_expired`.

  * **Metrics:** Track the health and performance of your application.

      * Use the `metrics` crate facade.
      * Expose a `/metrics` endpoint in the Prometheus exposition format.
      * **Key Metrics to Track:** Request latency, HTTP error rates (4xx/5xx), number of active WebSocket connections, Redis connection health, file upload/download speeds.

  * **Tracing:** For more complex systems, distributed tracing helps you follow a single request through its entire lifecycle. The `tracing` crate ecosystem supports this via OpenTelemetry.

## üöÄ Deployment & CI/CD

Automate everything to ensure reliable and repeatable deployments.

  * **Containerize Everything:** Use **Docker** to package your Axum backend. A multi-stage `Dockerfile` will create a small, optimized, and secure final image.

  * **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a pipeline using **GitHub Actions** or GitLab CI.

    1.  **On every push:** Run `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`.
    2.  **On merge to `main`:** Run all checks again, build the release binary, build the Docker image, and push it to a container registry (like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or AWS ECR).
    3.  **Deployment:** The final step is to trigger a deployment on your hosting platform to pull the new image and roll out the update.

  * **Hosting Platform:** While you can manage a server yourself, platforms-as-a-service (PaaS) are ideal for this kind of app.

      * **Fly.io** or **Render**: Excellent choices with first-class support for Rust and Docker. They handle load balancing, auto-scaling, and deployment automation for you.
      * **Kubernetes (K8s):** More complex but offers maximum power and scalability if you expect very high traffic.
