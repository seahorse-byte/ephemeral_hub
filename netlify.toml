# This is the command Netlify will run from the root of your repository.
# It specifically builds the `ephemeral_web` package.
command = "cargo install dioxus-cli && cd ephemeral_web && dx build --release --platform web"

# FIX: This is the correct path to the build output for a workspace project.
# It points directly to the final, public-ready files.
